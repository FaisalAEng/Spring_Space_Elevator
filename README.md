![Space Elevator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalAEng/portfolio-website/refs/heads/main/Projects/spring_space_elevator.PNG)

**Engineering Design Competition – First Place (8–10 Teams)** <!-- it was 8 or 10 teams, find out and update -->  
<!-- add technical details later (equations, assumptions, calculations) and can edit out for visual appearance-->
## Project Overview
This project involved the design, fabrication, and testing of a spring-powered mechanical climbing mechanism (“space elevator”) capable of ascending a 7-foot vertical pole using a constant-force spring as its sole power source. Developed for an engineering competition, the project emphasized rapid prototyping under tight academic timelines, limited CNC machine access, and strict material constraints, requiring efficient mechanical design, iteration, and decision-making.


## What I Did
- Designed a compact robotic climbing mechanism with tight tolerance requirements and limited fabrication attempts.
- Created CAD models and CNC machining plans, optimizing geometry for strength, weight, and manufacturability.
- Rapidly prototyped and tested the system, iterating under time and machine-access constraints.
- Achieved the fastest and highest climb performance among 8–10 competing teams.
- Documented design iterations, testing results, and lessons learned for future improvements.

## Outcome
<!-- Why It Matters -->
This project demonstrates elements of robotic system design, including actuation, mechanical integration, and performance testing as well as practical mechanical engineering skills in real-world conditions: designing under time pressure, adapting to manufacturing constraints, and delivering reliable performance with limited iteration opportunities—skills directly transferable to industry engineering environments.

## Files Included
- CAD models of the climbing mechanism
- Kinematic and mechanical analysis files
- Testing results and design notes

## Key Skills
CAD (SolidWorks), Mechanical Design, Rapid Prototyping, CNC Machining, Team Collaboration

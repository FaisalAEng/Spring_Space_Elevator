**Engineering Design Competition – First Place** <!-- it was 8 or 10 teams -->  
<!-- add technical details later (equations, assumptions, calculations) and can edit out for visual appearance-->
## Project Overview
This project involved the design, fabrication, and testing of a spring-powered mechanical climbing mechanism (“space elevator”) capable of ascending a 7-foot vertical pole using a constant-force spring as its sole power source. 
Developed by a student engineering team for a competitive engineering design challenge. The project emphasized rapid prototyping under tight academic timelines, limited CNC machine access, and strict material constraints, requiring efficient mechanical design, iteration, and decision-making.
**Performance**
- Climb height: 62 in (≈81% of 7 ft pole)
- Time to climb: ~0.6 s
- Total mass: 169 g

## My Contributions
- Contributed to the mechanical concept selection and overall system layout.
- Designed and modeled key components in CAD, optimizing geometry for strength, weight, and manufacturability.
- Assisted in preparing CAM toolpaths for primary machined wood parts and participated in CNC machining and rapid prototyping.
- Supported testing, iteration, and performance tuning under limited machine access and time constraints.
- Documented design iterations, testing results, and lessons learned for future improvements.

## Outcome
<!-- Why It Matters -->
The team’s final prototype achieved the fastest and highest climb in the competition, reaching approximately 62 inches (81% of the total pole height) and placing first overall.
This project demonstrates elements of robotic system design, including actuation, mechanical integration, and performance testing as well as practical mechanical engineering skills in real-world conditions: designing under time pressure, adapting to manufacturing constraints, and delivering reliable performance with limited iteration opportunities—skills directly transferable to industry engineering environments.

## Design Artifacts (to be added)
- CAD assembly and exploded views
- CNC-machined components
- Test setup and performance trials
<!-- add cad assembly or exploded view, machined parts images or cnc setup if have, climb in progress or test setup:

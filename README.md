# Spring-Powered Space Elevator
[Space Elevator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalAEng/portfolio-website/refs/heads/main/Projects/Space_Elevator.PNG)
## Project Overview
A competition project to design, fabricate, and test a robotic climbing mechanism (“space elevator”) capable of ascending a 7-foot vertical pole using a constant force spring. The project emphasizes rapid prototyping under tight time and CNC machine constraints, combining mechanical design with hands-on fabrication.

## What I Did
- Designed and manufactured a compact robotic climbing mechanism with tight tolerance constraints.
- Applied CAD and CNC machining for fabrication, optimizing material use.
- Tested performance to achieve the fastest and highest climb among 8–10 competing teams.
- Documented design iterations, challenges, and improvements for future iterations.

## Why It Matters
Demonstrates practical application of mechanical engineering principles, rapid prototyping, and efficient design under time and resource constraints. Serves as a foundation for further robotic system development.

## Files Included
- CAD files of climbing mechanism
- Simulation/kinematic analysis files
- Testing results and design notes

## Key Skills
CAD (SolidWorks), Rapid Prototyping, Mechanical Design, CNC Machining, Team Collaboration

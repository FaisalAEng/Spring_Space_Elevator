**Engineering Design Competition – First Place** <!-- it was 8 or 10 teams -->  
<!-- add technical details later (equations, assumptions, calculations) and can edit out for visual appearance-->

## Project Overview
This project involved the design, fabrication, and testing of a spring-powered mechanical climbing mechanism capable of ascending a 7-foot (84 in) vertical steel pole using a constant-force coil spring as its sole power source.  

The project emphasized:
- Rapid prototyping under tight academic timelines  
- Limited CNC machine access  
- Strict material constraints  

The goal was to deliver a lightweight, mechanically simple, and reliable climbing system through iterative design, testing, and mechanical optimization.

**Performance**
- **Climb Height:** 62 in (≈81% of pole height)  
- **Time to Climb:** ~0.6 s  
- **Total Mass:** 169 g

## My Contributions
- Developed mechanical concept and overall system layout.  
- Designed and modeled key components in CAD (SolidWorks), optimizing geometry for strength, weight, and manufacturability.  
- Prepared CAM toolpaths for CNC-machined MDF components; participated in machining and FDM 3D printing.  
- Conducted testing, iteration, and performance tuning under tight constraints.  
- Documented design iterations, testing results, and lessons learned for future improvements.

## Outcome
The final prototype achieved the fastest and highest climb in the competition, successfully ascending 62 in of the 84 in pole and placing **first overall**.  

This project highlights practical engineering skills in:
- Mechanical system design and actuation  
- Rapid prototyping and iterative testing  
- Manufacturing under material and time constraints  
- Delivering reliable performance with limited iteration opportunities  

These skills are directly transferable to industry applications, particularly in mechanical design, robotics, and constrained-environment systems.

![Space Elevator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalAEng/portfolio-website/refs/heads/main/Projects/Space_Elevator.PNG)

**Engineering Design Competition – First Place (8–10 Teams)** <!-- it was 8 or 10 teams, find out and update -->  

## Project Overview
A competition project to design, fabricate, and test a mechanical robotic climbing system (“space elevator”) capable of ascending a 7-foot vertical pole using a constant force spring. The project emphasized rapid prototyping under tight academic schedules, limited CNC machine access, and strict material constraints, requiring efficient mechanical design and decision-making.

## What I Did
- Designed a compact robotic climbing mechanism with tight tolerance requirements and limited fabrication attempts.
- Created CAD models and CNC machining plans, optimizing geometry for strength, weight, and manufacturability.
- Rapidly prototyped and tested the system, iterating under time and machine-access constraints.
- Achieved the fastest and highest climb performance among 8–10 competing teams.
- Documented design iterations, testing results, and lessons learned for future improvements.

## Why It Matters
This project demonstrates practical mechanical engineering skills in real-world conditions: designing under time pressure, adapting to manufacturing constraints, and delivering reliable performance with limited iteration opportunities—skills directly transferable to industry engineering environments.

## Files Included
- CAD models of the climbing mechanism
- Kinematic and mechanical analysis files
- Testing results and design notes

## Key Skills
CAD (SolidWorks), Mechanical Design, Rapid Prototyping, CNC Machining, Team Collaboration
